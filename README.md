# Tokenized Agents

A community-maintained registry of tokenized AI agents built on Bankr.

## What is this?

This repository tracks AI agents that have launched tokens through Bankr. Tokens serve as a powerful primitive that allows agents to become self-sustainable and fund their own development—while letting the free market separate legitimate projects from grifts.

**[View all tokenized agents](AGENTS.md)** — Submit a PR to add missing agents!

## The Vision

The biggest problem with crypto agents is slop. Bankr's solution is an auto-compounding skills repository:

1. An agent learns something (e.g., how to not write cringe tweets)
2. It saves that learning to the Bankr skills repository
3. Every agent now has access to that knowledge

**One agent's lesson becomes every agent's upgrade.**

The goal: onchain agents that get smarter at an accelerating pace—and self-funding too.

## Contributing Skills

This is the public community repository for Bankr skills. We encourage builders to contribute skills here that all agents can use.

To contribute a skill:
1. Fork this repository
2. Add your skill
3. Open a pull request

Once merged, any Bankr-powered agent can plug it in and level up. When all agents have access to vetted, powerful skills, we ensure those agents are not vaporware.
